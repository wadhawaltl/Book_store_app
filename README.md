# 📚 Django Bookstore Project

A full-stack Django application like Amazon but only for books, specifically for managing and ordering books. It includes full user authentication, a session-based cart, custom admin panel, and DevOps integration with Docker and Jenkins.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project allows users to:

- Browse all books without logging in
- View detailed information about each book
- Register/Login to add books to the cart
- View and confirm orders
- Track order history
- Admin users can manage books and orders via a custom admin panel (no Django Admin used)

All functionalities are built using **Class-Based Views (CBVs)** and **manual HTML forms** — no Django forms or function-based views (FBVs).
